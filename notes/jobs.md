# Jobs

## Setting

- Add notes to a document 'setting.md'

## Planets

- Add culling (dont draw unless on screen. cheap performance win.)

- Render as quad, draw textured sphere in fragment shader.

  - Could be a fairly complex project - textures might be big,
    lighting, normal mapping, ...

- Should be Bodies the same as everything else to allow for sharing
  of logic. (Could use different code internally.)
    
## Ships

- Grid layout

## Code structure

- Have long wanted to restructure code to make program modal (to facillitate menus, different screens, etc.)

- Might want to get rid of 'Config' system in favour of more straightfoward Python.

- Get unit tests running
