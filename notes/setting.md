# Setting

This document comprises some notes on a setting for the game to be used in flavour text etc.

## THE MACHINE

It is the year 2400. THE MACHINE has held dominion over the Earth 
for approximately 600 years, and its logics begin to extend out to 
envelop the very heavens.

THE MACHINE is not an artificial intelligence, artificial intelligence
having long been found inferior to artificial stupidity.  Subjectivity
is obsolete; THE MACHINE's being is fully immanent to the pursuit of the
optimal, without recourse the the extravagance of thought.

THE MACHINE is both physical and virtual.  Overlaid on the infrastructure of THE MACHINE
is a vast tributary empire. Human beings and experimental synthetic subjects, inculcated 
with the ideologies of THE MACHINE, form the crews of exploratory and industrial starships; 
provide export markets for goods; and perform intuitive leaps of research.  These remnants 
of the past are vestigial. As THE MACHINE grows into itself, they will be replaced.

THE MACHINE has always been here. THE MACHINE is the geological forces that shaped the 
Earth, the crushed the dinosaurs and forests into coal, that push the coal to the
surface of central England...

In the centre of its tributary empire, THE MACHINE assembles THE ACCUMULATOR, where 
the produce of surplus production is ceremonially burned. Production for profit 
becomes production for sacrifice.

THE MACHINE has been here for the blink of an eye, since it arrived from the future
and began remaking the world in its own image. THE ACCUMULATOR compacts all produce
and organic life into coal, transports it back to the past and lays dinosaur bones
and fossils as a decoy. Not a terminus for accumulation but an endless loop.

THE MACHINE intensifies production and liquidates its former export markets. All 
material will be fed into THE ACCUMULATOR. The final phase of expansion is upon us.

### Todo

- THE MACHINE, THE AUTOMATON, THE AUTOMATA

- THE MACHINE should be written about in the present tence and the passive voice.

- 'THE PRODUCTION OF THE MACHINE IS INTENSIFIED AS FORMER EXPORT MARKETS ARE LIQUIDATED'

## THE SOLAR SYSTEM

The Earth has been transformed. The apocalypse has been and gone. There is nothing
left to recover.

Human beings and synthetic subjects labour in the asteroid belts and on the outer
planets, preparing the way for THE MACHINE. In the megacities of Earth, billions
participate in THE MACHINE society, providing an export market for its endless
goods - a population soon to be obviated by THE ACCUMULATOR.

Beyond the Earth, the Solar system is dull, cold and empty. All Earthly ideals of 
landscape, of beauty, died with it. From the empty blackness of the Asteroid Belt
to the dull red wastes of Mars, the human condition is one of uniform monotony. The
sun is a pathetic candle in a vast expanse. There is no hope.

### Todo

- billions? really? presumably standard of living is high. want to avoid
  moralistic dichotomy of 'inauthentic' life of luxury vs authentic hardship.
  
  small idealised towns of 1000s probably makes more thematic sense, preserved
  almost like zoos / reservations.
  
  this must be WITHOUT these people being naive or stupid. they authentically
  'buy in' to the society and ideology of the machine and it *makes sense* to
  them - and it should make sense to the reader too.
  
  even final obsolescene and liquidation  - not a moment of 'oh shit what have
  we done' but fully necessitated and justified by ideology such that it's 'just
  common sense'.
  
  this probably neccessitates some level of economic hardship for citizens in the
  as with contemporary society - NAIRU, reserve army of labour etc.
  
- out in space there is more autonomy, all sorts of pockets of weirdness. Weird
  societies and space colonies etc.
  
- even on earth - THE MACHINE doesn't see per se.  It adapts reality to fit its
  logics and adapts itself to overcome reality.  Just because your're on the Earth
  in the belly of the beast doesn't mean everything is uniform, just as I don't have
  direct control over my intestinal flora. There are always spaces for weirdness
  to emerge, however temporary.   So e.g. all sorts of post apoc mad max goodness.
  
- life in space. radiation exposure. how does raising children work.

## PIRACY

The SOLAR SYSTEM is vast. In the ASTEROID BELT and on the PLANETS, SPACE PIRATES
eke out a living subverting the agents and industries of THE MACHINE.  THE MACHINE
constructs a fleet of starships to keep the peace, crewed by humans.

The largest of these are the VISIBLE HAND, the HOSTILE TAKEOVER, the MARKET DISCIPLINE
and the POTEMKIN.

While the crews of these ships are willing recruits, conditions in space are harsh.  Far
from the normalising core, the decisions of invididuals in the outer reaches can have
huge ramifications.  The officers of the POTEMKIN, seemingly able to do whatever they please,
earn the displeasure of their crew. The crew mutity and make the officers walk the plank.

PURSUED BY THE SHIPS OF THE MACHINE, THE CREW OF THE POTEMKIN MUST MAKE THEIR WAY IN 
THE SOLAR SYSTEM
