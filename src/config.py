"""
A config is a hierarchical data store exactly like a JSON tree.

However each node in the tree is exposed as a Config object, which provides
capabilities such as a 'safe' getter with a default value supplied.

Additionally, if in the underlying data a node has a 'derive_from' entry, the
specified config is loaded and merged into the derived node. This works
recursively, at any point in the tree. This allows one config to be derived
from another. The 'derive_from' key is not accessible from the resulting Config
object. The merging is done recursively so e.g. if there are two child maps
called 'components' in the root maps being merged, the child maps get merged
rather than one being overridden by the other. For leaf nodes, the derived
config takes precedence.

If a Config object was read from a file, it remembers the filename and can be
written out via save().

Configs are read from and written to YAML. Configs are read such that the order
of iteration of Config maps is in 'document order' - this is a departure from
the norm where YAML maps are unordered.
